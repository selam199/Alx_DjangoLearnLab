# Advanced API Project

This project demonstrates how to use Django REST Framework's generic views and custom serializers.

## API Endpoints

### Retrieve all books
- `GET /api/books/`
- **Response**: List of all books.

### Retrieve a single book
- `GET /api/books/<id>/`
- **Response**: Details of a specific book.

### Create a new book (Authenticated users only)
- `POST /api/books/`
- **Body**: `{ "title": "Book Title", "publication_year": 2024, "author": 1 }`

### Update a book (Authenticated users only)
- `PUT /api/books/<id>/`

### Delete a book (Authenticated users only)
- `DELETE /api/books/<id>/`
# Advanced API Project - Book CRUD Operations

## Endpoints
- **GET /books/** - Retrieve a list of all books.
- **GET /books/<int:pk>/** - Retrieve a single book by its ID.
- **POST /books/create/** - Create a new book (Authenticated users only).
- **PUT /books/<int:pk>/update/** - Update an existing book (Authenticated users only).
- **DELETE /books/<int:pk>/delete/** - Delete a book (Authenticated users only).

## Permissions
- `IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly` - Allows unauthenticated users to view books but restricts modification.
- `IsAuthenticated` - Requires authentication for modifying or deleting books.
- `IsOwnerOrReadOnly` - Ensures only the owner of the book can modify or delete it.


# API Enhancements: Filtering, Searching, and Ordering

## Filtering
The following fields can be used to filter books:
- `title`: Filter by book title.
- `author`: Filter by book author.
- `publication_year`: Filter by the year the book was published.


## Test Coverage
The test cases verify the following functionalities:

1. **CRUD Operations**
   - Listing all books
   - Retrieving a single book
   - Creating a new book
   - Updating an existing book
   - Deleting a book

2. **Advanced Querying**
   - Filtering books by title
   - Searching books by author
   - Ordering books by publication year

3. **Authentication and Permissions**
   - Ensures only authenticated users can create, update, or delete books

This testing strategy ensures the robustness of your API and verifies that all endpoints function correctly. ðŸš€ Let me know if you need modifications! ðŸ˜Š
